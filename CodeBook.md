The run_analysis.R script performs the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

Assign each data to variables: 
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test 
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test 
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X 

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalDataSet (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalDataSet into FinalDataSet.txt file.
